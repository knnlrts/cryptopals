# Challenge 14: Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Harder)
#
# Take your oracle function from #12. Now generate a random count of random bytes and prepend this string to every plaintext. You are now doing:
# AES-128-ECB(random-prefix || attacker-controlled || target-bytes, random-key)
#
# Same goal: decrypt the target-bytes.
#
# Stop and think for a second.
# What's harder than challenge #12 about doing this? How would you overcome that obstacle?
# The hint is: you're using all the tools you already have; no crazy math is required.
#
# Think "STIMULUS" and "RESPONSE".
